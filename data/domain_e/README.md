## Reproducibility

To regenerate the raw and processed outputs:

```
python3 src/preprocessing/extract_thennt_nnt.py
python3 src/preprocessing/compile_fda_pivotal_trials.py
```

To regenerate summary tables:

```
python3 src/analysis/e1_nnt_summary.py
python3 src/analysis/e2_fda_summary.py
```

Notes
- Time horizons and population details should be verified against primary
  sources cited by TheNNT. Rows needing verification are flagged with
  "[VERIFY]" in the notes column.
