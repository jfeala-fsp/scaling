# Domain B: Domestication and Early Breeding

## Summary

ESP calculations for the transition from natural to artificial selection (~10,000 years ago).

## Species Analyzed

| Species | Domestication | Founder Ne | Generations | Phenotypes | ESP | log₁₀(ESP) |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----|------------|
| Wheat | 10,500 BP, Fertile Crescent | 32,500 | 2,500 | 10 | 8.1×10⁶ | 6.9 |
| Maize | 9,000 BP, Mexico | 2,000-2,500 | 3,700 | 5 | 1.5×10⁶ | 6.2 |
| Dogs | 15-40 kya, Asia | 625 | 200 | 12 | 3.3×10⁴ | 4.5 |
| Cattle | 10,500 BP, Near East | ~80 females | 750 | 6 | 2.5×10⁵ | 5.4 |

## Key Findings

1. **ESP Range**: 10⁴ to 10⁷ (within expected 10⁶ - 10¹⁰ range from research plan)

2. **Dogs are most efficient**: ESP ~33,000 due to:
   - Neural crest pleiotropy (domestication syndrome coupling)
   - Major-effect loci (IGF1 explains 50% of size variation)
   - Belyaev fox experiment shows ESP ~625 under controlled 10% selection

3. **Wheat is least efficient**: ESP ~8.1×10⁶ due to:
   - Protracted domestication (2,000-3,000 years for trait fixation)
   - Large effective population under selection
   - Multiple independent quantitative traits

4. **Cattle show extreme bottleneck**: ~80 founding females → 1 billion modern cattle

5. **Maize shows dramatic phenotypic transformation**: Teosinte → maize controlled by ~1,200 genes (2-4% of genome)
