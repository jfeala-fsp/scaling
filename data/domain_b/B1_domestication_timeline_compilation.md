# B1: Domestication Timeline Compilation

Compiled for key species in Domain B (Domestication and Early Breeding). This
summary consolidates domestication timelines, population sizes, and trait
fixation estimates used for ESP calculations.

## Timeline Summary (Key Species)

| Species | Domestication start | Location | Duration (years) | Generation time (years) | Founder Ne / bottleneck | Population under selection | Trait fixation highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wheat (Triticum spp.) | 10,500 BP (8500 BCE) | Fertile Crescent | 2,000-3,000 | 1 | Ne_wild ~32,500 (20,739-45,991); Ne_dom ~12,000 | 100,000-1,000,000 | Non-shattering: 1,000-3,000 gen; larger grain: 500-1,500 gen; free-threshing: 500-2,000 gen; reduced dormancy: 500-1,000 gen |
| Maize (Zea mays) | 9,000 BP | Balsas River (Mexico) | 3,700+ | 1 | Bottleneck Ne ~20 for ~10 gen; avg Ne 2,000-2,500 | ~15,000 | tb1 (single stalk): <500 gen; tga1 (naked kernels): 3,700+ gen; non-shattering: <1,000 gen; kernel rows: 1,000-5,000 gen |
| Dogs (Canis familiaris) | 27-40 kya (genetic); 14-15 kya (arch) | East/Central Asia (debated) | 5,000-13,000 gen | 3 | Founder Ne ~625 (500-1,000) | 2,000 (initial), 10,000 (early), 100,000 (breed era) | Reduced fear: 10-40 gen; floppy ears: 8-30 gen; curly tails: 10-25 gen; piebald: 8-20 gen; size: 100-500 gen |
| Cattle (Bos taurus / Bos indicus) | 10,500 BP (taurine); 8,000 BP (zebu) | Near East / South Asia | ~2,000+ | 4.5 | Taurine founder females ~80 (~160 total) | Geometric mean ~2,000 | Body size reduction: 800-1,000 gen; docility: 50-200 gen; polled: 3-5 gen; milk yield (modern): 15-20 gen (post-1950) |

## Notes

- Trait fixation ranges reflect multiple lines of evidence (archaeobotanical,
  quantitative genetics, and ancient DNA). These are approximate and used for
  order-of-magnitude ESP calculations.
- Dog domestication start date remains debated; both genetic divergence and
  secure archaeological dates are provided.
- Cattle domestication includes independent taurine and zebu events.
